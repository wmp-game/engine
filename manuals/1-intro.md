# Introduction

**WMP** stands for **W**arrior, **M**age and **P**riest. It's a game in which the
players program their own AI's in Python in order to thrive.

Each player has a warrior, a mage and a priest at his disposal to fight in a 30m
x 30m arena for 100 seconds. The battle stops when the timer goes to zero or when
all characters of a team die. The team that has the highest sum of HP amongst its
units wins.
